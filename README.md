   - To check the fidelity of your install, open up a terminal on your machine and run the command `node --version` to see what version of nodejs you're running.
   - A version higher than 12 is preferred. You can also run `npm --version` and `npx --version` to see the versions of `npm` and `npx` that you are running respectively.
   - I am running version `7.20.6` of npx and npm, and version `14.17.5` of nodejs during the time of building these applications.

4. A GitHub account to access and download source code files.
